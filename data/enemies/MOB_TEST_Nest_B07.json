{"info": "We should be careful. It’s Nest, the expert connector. I'll report the information obtained from the battle.\n\nFirst, Nest shoots out combat machines from the body's CAD and sends enormous power to those machines.\n\nSecond, if the body continues to be attacked, it deploys a barrier on its own.\n\nThird, it became weak temporarily when the ejected machine was destroyed while the barrier was deployed. And it seems that some weapon systems become unstable when they are attacked by elements.\n\nThat's all I got for now. It’ll be pretty much difficult battle. Commander, please take the lead.\n\n-Reporter Leona", "HP": [35500, 500], "ATK": [165, 15], "DEF": [1220, 20], "AGI": 4.5, "CRT": 5, "HIT": 400, "DOD": 0, "resist": [25, 25, 25], "skills": ["Skill_TEST_Nest_N_1", "Skill_TEST_Nest_N_2", "Skill_TEST_Nest_N_3", "Skill_TEST_Nest_N_4", "Skill_TEST_Nest_N_5"]}
